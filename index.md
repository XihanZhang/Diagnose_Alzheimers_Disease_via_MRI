title: Diagnose Alzheimer's Disease by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
---


## Problem Statement and Motivation


**Alzheimer's Disease(AD)** is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that starts with neuron degeneration, which then cause large scale change in brain structure$^{1}$. Since volumetric and functional magnetic resonance imaging have proved to represent robust biomarkers for the evaluation of anti-Alzheimer treatments$^{2}$, we decided to diagnose AD via **magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)**.


## Research Question

Given the data sets suffer from a lot of **missing follow-up data**, we focused our main research question on building classifier models for patients? **baseline diagnosis** using patients? **brain imaging data from their first visits**, *adjusting for basic demographic information.*
